# useInput

`useInput` lets you wait for input messages.

```js
const messages = await useInput()
```

## Reference

### `useInput()`

Call `useInput` at the top level of your component to wait for input messages.

```js
import { useInput } from '@performer/core';

async function User() {
  const messages = await useInput();
  // ...
}
```

Used by the [`User`](/components/User) component to wait for user input.

#### Parameters

`useInput` does not take any parameters.

#### Returns

`useInput` returns a Promise that resolves to an array of `PerformerMessage`

#### Caveats

- `useInput` is a Hook, it must be called at the top level of the component or your own Hooks. You can't call it inside loops or conditions. It must be called before any `await` expressions.
