# useMessages

`useMessages` lets you get the currently rendered messages.

```js
const messages = useMessages()
```

## Reference

### `useMessages()`

Call `useMessages` at the top level of your component to an ordered array of currently rendered messages.

```js
import { useMessages } from '@performer/core';

function MyAssistant () {
  const messages = useMessages();
  // send message to language model for completion
  // ...
```

`useMessages` is used by the [`Assistant`](/components/Assistant) component to make a request to the language model.

#### Parameters

`useMessages` does not take any parameters.

#### Returns

`useMessages` returns an array of `PerformerMessage`.

#### Caveats

- `useMessages` is a Hook, it must be called at the top level of the component or your own Hooks. You can't call it inside loops or conditions. It must be called before any `await` expressions.
