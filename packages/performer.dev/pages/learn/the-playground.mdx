This playground is a chat interface for testing your Performer app.

The playground is not intended to be a replacement for developing your own UI. However, the playground is open-source with the Apache 2.0
licensed, you are free to use its code and components in your frontends.

## How it works

The playground is a React app with a Vite server. Start the playground using the `playground <path>` CLI, this will
start the Vite server in dev mode and resolve any modules in `<path>`.

Modules that export an `App` function are assumed to be Performer apps. Export `name` and `slug` to customize the app metadata.

Resolved apps are listed in the sidebar. Click on an app to being a chat.
