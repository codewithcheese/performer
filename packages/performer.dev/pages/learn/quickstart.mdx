# Quickstart

Follow this quickstart guide to create and deploy your first Performer app in just a few minutes.

## Create a new project

To start your adventure, run the following command in your terminal to create a new Performer project:

```sh npm2yarn
npm create performer@latest
```

Thatâ€™s it! Navigate to your projectâ€™s directory, and explore your first Performer app ðŸ¥³

## Run the playground

Run the playground to start a chat with your Performer app:

```sh npm2yarn
npm run playground
```

You will be prompted to enter your OpenAI API Key. The key lives in your browser's local storage and does not leave your machine.
Alternatively create a `.env` file and set `VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY=`.

## Start editing your app

A Performer project can contain multiple apps. The `create` command creates a single app in the `src` directory. `./src/chat.tsx`

Edit this file to customize the behaviour of your app.
